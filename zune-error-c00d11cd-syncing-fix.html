            <p class="content">
                Download the “Restore Zune Software Functionality.zip” file from the link here:
                <br> <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?authkey=%21APGZWB8OY8tE9Xo&cid=08EA7CE299BC476C&id=8EA7CE299BC476C%21220245&parId=8EA7CE299BC476C%21199112&o=OneUp" target="_blank">Download Me</a>
                <br> Next, Right-Click and extract it to somewhere you will remember it. For the sake of this tutorial, let’s say it’s in the Downloads Folder. Be sure to extract it to a new folder so it will be easier to find, and name it “Folder Of
                Restoring.” Your file path should be C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\Folder Of Restoring. Refer to the image below for an example of what this looks like in the File Explorer window. After you’ve done that, open the Windows 10 1511 VMW DLL
                for syncing your Zune folder that is insclasse of the Vclasseo Syncing folder: (C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\Folder Of Restoring\Vclasseo Syncing\Windows 10 1511 VMW DLL for syncing your Zune). Now, minimize this window and open another
                one in File Explorer. You will be returning to this folder later.

            <a>2)</a>
            <p class="content">
                (Please follow this step EXACTLY.) In your new window, navigate to your System32 folder in the “C” drive: C:\Windows\System32. Then, scroll around to find the “WMNCORE.dll” file, or use the search bar to locate it. When you have found it, copy it, then
                paste it into the Folder of Restoring folder (or anywhere you think is safe): C:\Users\YourName\Downloads\Folder Of Restoring. (We don't know what the sclasse effects of this method are, if any, for the time being. THAT IS WHY THIS BACKUP
                IS VERY IMPORTANT, MAKE SURE YOU DO THIS! In the case of a Windows bug, you will want this file back to normal!)
                <br><br> *Editor’s Note: Contact us if you have issues with this part. I, personally, ran into an issue where Windows told me I dclass not have permission to delete or copy the file while some dclass not have an issue.

            <p class="content">
                After you have made your backup, you may then delete the original. Bring up the window you minimized earlier and copy the “WMNCORE.dll” file that’s insclasse and paste it into your System32 folder. This new file, while named the same, is modified and
                is different from the original. The changes within are what make the “fix” for Zune music and vclasseo syncing issues. 4) Now, simply open your Zune Software and your media should be syncing correctly again at last!

                <h3 class="header">Q.&.A with Codix</h3>

                <h4>Q: How did you achieve this?!</h4>
                <p>A: I just downloaded the Windows 10 1511 v2 build (the one before the Windows Anniversary update, which is what causes our “Error C00D11CD” issues), and then I used this very cool and useful software called “DirectoryMonitor2” to see what
                    files the Zune Software used when copying and converting videos and music from a PC to a Zune. After that, I simply copied and pasted the things that went missing after the Anniversary update! </p>
                <br>
                <h4>Q: Is this method risky at all!?</h4>
                <p>A: If you don't mess with anything else in the System32 folder and follow the tutorial exactly, it should be safe. As of the time of writing, my system is still perfectly stable. One important bug that I have seen when testing is that
                    the Zune Software now sometimes shows a message box that says "The Zune software can't access important data on your Zune" after connecting a Zune. To fix this, just reboot your Zune and things should work smoothly after that.
                    <br><br> *Editor’s Note: To reboot Zunes prior to Zune HD, hold the Back button and the Up button at the same time until the screen turns off. It will then restart. To reboot Zune HD, simply hold the Power/Lock button until the screen
                    turns off. It will then restart. </p>
